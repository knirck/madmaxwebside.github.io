      <h3 id="section_1">The MADMAX experiment: searching for axion dark matter</h3>
      <p> The axion is one of the few hypothetical particles that can solve two
        major problems in physics:  &ldquo;What is the nature of dark matter?&rdquo;
        and  &ldquo;why strong interaction is invariant under time
        reversal?&rdquo; (the strong CP). Scientists working on the recently
        initiated MADMAX (Magnetized Disc and Mirror Axion Experiment) project
        are looking for fascinating new particle. </p>

      <p> Axions would be unlike any of the known particles: cosmological models
         suggest that the axion&prime;s mass would be between one microelectronvolt
         and one millielectronvolt, much lighter than even neutrinos, the
         lightest of known massive particles. </p>

      <p> MADMAX would take advantage of the quantum mechanical mixing of
        particles &ndash; the ability of certain particles to take on the properties
        of other particles. In a static magnetic field, an axion behaves a
        little bit like a photon, developing a small electric field. The
        stronger the magnetic field, the more &ldquo;photon-like&rdquo; the axion becomes.
        If we could detect this electric field, we could verify the existence
        of dark matter axions. </p>

      <h4 id="section_2">Dielectric media in a strong magnetic field</h4>
      <p> Pivotal to detecting this electric field is the effect a change in
        dielectric media has on the axion. Dielectrics are simply non-conducting
         substances, like air, sapphire or plastic, though this also occurs in a
          mirror. The axion&prime;s tiny electric field is broken at the boundary
          between the two media, resulting in electromagnetic radiation
          (microwaves) being emitted. </p>

      <p> These electromagnetic waves are emitted at right angles from surface
        of the interface, allowing one to measure them by focusing the radiation
         into a detector. As the frequency of the radiation is given by the mass
          of the axion, cosmological considerations suggest that it could lie
          between 0.25 and 250 gigahertz. Unfortunately, even a sharp change in
          interface (as given by a one square meter mirror) inside a very
          powerful 10 tesla magnetic field is not enough to see axions. The
          signal would only be a paltry 10<sup>-27</sup> watts, beyond detectibility even
          with the most sensitive detectors. </p>

      <h4 id="section_3">Boosting the signal: dielectric haloscopes</h4>
      <p> To search for axions, we must have some way of boosting the signal.
        Fortunately, this conversion of axions to microwave radiation would
        happen at any change of media. </p>

      <p> By having many dielectric disks, one can combine the electromagnetic
        waves generated at multiple interfaces. In addition, reflections between
         the disks can cause resonance effects, further amplifying the signal.
         By carefully positioning the disks, one can use these effects
         coherently to amplify the conversion of axions to photons in a specific
          frequency range, and thus search a range of axion masses. Such a
          device is called a &ldquo;dielectric haloscope&rdquo;. </p>

      <p> This is the plan of the MADMAX experiment: to boost the signal by
        using 80 dielectric disks in addition to the mirror, each with an area
        of one square meter and a high refractive index. The disks have to be
        positioned with micrometer precision. This setup will be contained in a
        10 tesla magnetic field &ndash; by comparison a simple fridge magnet is only
        about 0.05 tesla. Scientists plan to use radiometers to detect the
        microwaves. </p>

      <p> By using this many disks, one could achieve a signal that is tens or
        hundreds of thousands times stronger than a single mirror. This would
        give a signal in the order of 10<sup>-23</sup> watt, which can be detected with
        current detector technology. </p>

      <h4 id="section_4">MADMAX experimental setup</h4>
      <p> The underlying principle has already been tested in initial
        experimental setups. While lacking a magnet, these setups had up to five
         sapphire disks (20 centimeters in diameter).  With this kind of setup,
         it was possible to create an interference effect with the necessary
         precision and size. A dummy signal in the order of 10<sup>-23</sup> watt was
         detected in a week-long measurement. </p>

      <p> These results have been so promising that an interest group has formed
         to realise a dielectric haloscope in a full scale experiment. </p>
